# Retro Game Development and Software Preservation

This is a repository that captures source code and development materials for
retro game development and purposes of software preservation. The materials
in this repository are from out of print books or lost to the internet.

Do not expect the code samples in this repository to compile on modern
machines. Some of this code predates modern standards as it was originally
written in the late 1980s to early 1990s.
